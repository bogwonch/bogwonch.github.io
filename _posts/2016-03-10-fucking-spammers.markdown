I *hate* marketers.
I *loathe* recruiters.
I get a *lot* of spam asking me to _“join a Webinar[^1]”_ or _“start a startup[^2]”_: inevitably all these emails are from recruitment companies masquerading under the guise of friendly academic collaboration.
Well guess what?  I don’t like _friendly academic collaboration_.
If you have an email like this from me, it means I don’t like you.

My favorite response so far included:

Guess someones been reading my CV.
Would be nice if they actually knew what they were talking about and referenced something I’d done in the last five years eh?

And my technical history isn’t impressive FYI.
It isn’t bad.  I’ve worked on some interesting projects in my time, but it isn’t impressive.
I’m quite competent, but that’s about it.
Stop trying to stroke my ego: if you want my interest talk tech to me and go into lots of deep technical details.
I’m an engineer.  More tech. Less platitudes.

Eurgh.
Fuck these guys.
