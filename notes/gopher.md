Gopher is a strange one.
It's a protocol from the 90s that is _like_ the HTTP, but is for directory listings.
You can serve a webpage if you like; but mostly you list the directory, maybe some informational messages, and any content you want to serve.
That focus on content means that I still love it.

It has it's problems (a distinct lack of a secure, private variant for starters), but it is still worthy of interest and a second look.
It's also *really* simple.
Implementing a server will make a good kata for someone wanting to do a bit of TCP programming, and a client would be a nice bit of UI programming.

With that in mind I've translated RFC1436 (the nearest thing to a standard Gopher has) to ePub and Kindle formats so I can read them on the go.
Might even have a go at implementing some clients in new languages I want to learn, and maybe creating a TLS variant.

I'd also *really* like to get this site running in Gopher space...
