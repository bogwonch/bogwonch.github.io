<p>Some friends of mine run a D&amp;D club, and introduced me to it. They run short missions designed to introduce people to D&amp;D. Shortly before I moved away I asked if I could run a session, where I'd kill off my character <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brianperfect/">Brian Perfect</a> and have some last fun.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="imgs/brian-perfect.s.jpeg" alt="Brian in all his Lego glory." />
<p class="caption">Brian in all his Lego glory.</p>
</div>
<p>These are my notes from the session I ran.</p>
<h1 id="setup">Setup</h1>
<p>The adventurecateers and <em>Brian Perfect</em> are brought into a briefing with the head of the Hearthstone's laundry.</p>
<p>She explains that the hearthstone is running out of towels. They never expected so many people to join the ship, never mind whole villages of refugees. Someone has been using towels as backdrops for ebay pictures; someone else has been wrapping corpses and orc heads in them.</p>
<p>They've found a universe with a very high density of towels, and a ship carrying at least 13 of them. Luckilly they've found a universe with towels, and you're going to be beamed stealthilly onto a ship carrying them. Your mission is to get as many as you can, then get off the ship somehow where the pod will take you back.</p>
<p>She says that if they can get back enough of them she has some special rewards!</p>
<p>As you're about to leave the head of housekeeping remarks that she hears the inhabitants of the ship are big poetry fans... she says she is a poet too, and whilst she wouldn't recommend interacting with the ship's owners she wonders what they'd think of her poetry.</p>
<p>She hands <em>Brian Perfect</em> a copy of her book /&quot;Paula Nancy Milstone Jennings Collected Works&quot;/ to Brian. Brian opens it and reads a line before screaming and collapsing on the floor in the foetal position, gurgling and with white froth around his mouth. She sighs and says that this always seems to happen when people read her poetry as she wanders off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dead swans lay in the stagnant pool. They lay. They rotted. They turned Around occasionally. Bits of flesh dropped off them from Time to time. And sank into the pool's mire. They also smelt a great deal.</p>

<h1 id="fight-with-the-vogon">Fight with the Vogon</h1>
<p>You enter to see a VOGON beating up a DENTRASI underneath a MATTRESS. The vogon appears to be saying how the jeweled crab the dentrassi gave him wasn't polished well.</p>
<p>As you enter the Vogon notices you, and the matress springs (PUN) into action.</p>
<dl>
<dt>FIGHT Vogon:</dt>

<dd>Towel with snot on it (causes 1 Grossness damage if towel whipped).
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="after-fight">After fight</h2>
<p>The Vogon screams and runs off crying.</p>
<p>The Dentrasi is really grateful for your help. He offers to cook you and your party a dinner he was going to give to the vogons, and gives you his pet matress <em>Zem</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>PERCEPTION:</dt>
<dd>Above 15: there's another towel in the corner of the room.

<p>Anouncement from the Vogon commander. They've detected you.</p>
<p>The Dentrassi says still come for dinner: he's got some towels you can have.</p>
<h1 id="dinner--d">Dinner :-D</h1>
<p>The Dentrassi takes you into it's quarters and offers to fix you a drink plus some for the road. He heads off into the kitchen to get <em>the meat</em> for you.</p>
<p><strong>ROLL D6+Party-size for <em>Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters</em>.</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>ITEM <em>Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster</em></dt>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>PERCEPTION: Above 15: A bottle of that Old Janx Spirit.</p>
<p>The Dentrassi wheels in trolley with a <em>Ameglian Major Cow</em> on it, and THREE TOWELS. The cow explains that she is the &quot;dish of the day; may I Interest you in parts of my body?&quot;</p>
<p>Something off my shoulder perhaps? Brazed in a little white wine sauce?</p>
<p>(If they ask the cow's name... it's Nancy.)</p>
<p>ROLL FOR INITIATIVE.</p>
<p>FIGHT <em>Nancy</em>: Stats immaterial. After two rounds there will be no more meat left and Nancy will be dead. Nancy goes first in order, will always add sauce to body. If the party delivers a succesful attack they'll gain Nancy meat from the appropriate place. Nancy will scream in pleasure/pain as they lop bits off. Refusal to attack Nancy will result in her crying and doing it for them.</p>
<dl>
<dt>PICKPOCKET Nancy</dt>
<dd>Part of her liver... delicious.
</dd>
<dt>ITEM Nancy meat:</dt>
<dd>Restores health equivalent to a first aid kit.

<p>Party should remember to take the towel Nancy was lying on. Trying to take it before Nancy is dead makes her yell for some dignity in her death.</p>
<h2 id="after-dinner">After Dinner</h2>
<p>A gold spaceship teleports into the room.</p>
<p><em>Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged</em> appears and says to the second alphabetically member of your party:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>Out of 100,000 sperm you were really the fastest?
Your entire species sprang from apes but you didn&#39;t spring far enough.
And wipe your chin you disgusting croonfondler... no not that one, third one down.

<h1 id="poetry-slam">Poetry Slam</h1>
<p>Three heavily armed Vogons burst in and shoot the Dentrassi and throw nets over the adventurecateers. They are dragged across the ship towards the bridge and <em>Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz</em>, the captain.</p>
<p>The captain informs them that they are to be all put to death then flushed out of the airlock... but there is one way... one simple way for thm to avoid their fate... if they can defeat him in a poetry slam.</p>
<p>Players are thrown into a metalic pit with 80ft sheer walls (I see you Rooster Talisman). An audience of Vogons and Dentrassi watch the fight, booing and cheering.</p>
<dl>
<dt>FIGHT <em>Jeltz</em>:</dt>
<dd>STR 18, STA 20, AGL 0, DEX 0, FGT 6, INT -2, AWE 0, PRE 0 To defeat jeltz use the poetry book 3-6 times on him (depending on how things are going). Attacks primarily with poetry: same an PNMJ but 10 damage. Players can shelter behind <em>Zem</em> for defence against the poetry. Players can attack <em>Jeltz</em> to stop him attacking with his own poetry, and instead attack with his fists.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Every other round the audience will throw fruit. If the audience are particularly pleased a cow may throw some of their meat.</p>
<dl>
<dt>PICKPOCKET <em>Jeltz</em>:</dt>
<dd>Above 15: A towel monogrammed PVJ.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="after-the-fight">After the fight</h2>
<p>Jeltz throws in <em>The Towel</em>.</p>
<p>Jeltz collapses. &quot;That was worse than Poetmaster Grunthoss the Flatulent. I'm going to throw you off the ship anyway.&quot; Jeltz summons guards who take you to the number three airlock but not before...</p>
<p>ITEM <em>The Towel</em>: Throwing it stops an enemy attacking that turn (can be used once per fight).</p>
<h2 id="insults">Insults</h2>
<p>A gold spaceship teleports into the room.</p>
<p><em>Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged</em> appears, this time dressed in Elizabethan garb, and says to the third alphabetically member of your party:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>Methink&#39;st thou art a general offence and every man should beat thee,
You scullion! You rampallian! You fustilarian! I&#39;ll tickle your catastrophe!

<p>Wowbagger turns and leaves.</p>
<dl>
<dt>PICKPOCKET <em>Wowbagger</em>:</dt>
<dd>A towel monogrammed WS.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Attempts to attack wowbagger lop bits of him off, but then he sighs, /&quot;your virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese&quot;/, and slaps the attacker with whatever they lopped off before sticking it back on. (5 damage)</p>
<h1 id="airlock">Airlock</h1>
<p>You're thrown in an airlock. Metalic grey walls, and no possible hope of escape.</p>
<dl>
<dt>PERCEPTION:</dt>
<dd>Hey wait, what's this switch... no wait I was only kidding you are going to die after all.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A hologram of <em>Paula Nancy Milstone Jennings</em> appears before you. She asks you how you're doing, she says that she reckons they should have got 13 towels by now...</p>
<ul>
<li>4 towels: Medium reward <em>Lemon Pledge</em></li>
<li>7 towels: Small reward <em>Detol</em>.</li>
<li><p>10 towels: Large reward <em>Mr. Muscle</em></p></li>
<li>ITEM Detol: :: Detol protects and thats a fact. (Level 1 protection). Also kills 99% of all known germs instantly.</li>
<li>ITEM Lemon Pledge: :: Makes something super shiny and ultra-reflective.</li>
<li><p>ITEM Mr Muscle: :: He loves the jobs you hate. Allows user to pass any strength check (or drain unblocker) once per adventure.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>She beams the towels aboard, but then also tells you that shes figured out that if there are less crew on board the Hearthstone, then there is less need for towels. You're on your own. She vanishes and the airlock doors open.</p>
<h2 id="dying-in-the-vacuum-in-space">Dying in the vacuum in space</h2>
<p>Takes 30s.</p>
<p>If anyone makes a perception check they see Wowbagger in the distance holding a sign and pointing at the fourth member of the party:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>There are no words for how disgusting you are.
Well, there are, but YOU never learned them.
</code></pre>
<p>After 29.5s everyone crashes into the <em>Heart of Gold</em> running under full improbability.</p>
<h1 id="post-adventure-pan-galactic-gargle-blasters-with-zaphod-beebelbrox.">Post Adventure Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters with Zaphod Beebelbrox.</h1>
<p>The party crash onto a ship. Not like the Vogon ship, all flashing lights and bright pannels.</p>
<p>It looks a bit like Brighton beach except the waves are staying still and the seafront is washing up and down. There is a door at the end of the room.</p>

<p>He questions how you got on his ship, the HEART OF GOLD, but it boils down to you got lucky. He makes you all more Pan Galactic gargle blasters, and offers to run you back to the Heartstone.</p>
<p>Wowbagger appears but Zaphod shoots him with his <em>Kill-O-Zap pistol</em> and he makes a swift retreat.</p>
