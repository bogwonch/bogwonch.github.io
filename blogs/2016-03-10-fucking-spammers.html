I <em>loathe</em> recruiters. I get a <em>lot</em> of spam asking me to <em>“join a Webinar <a href=#fn1 class=footnoteRef id=fnref1><sup>1</sup></a>”</em> or <em>“start a startup <a href=#fn2 class=footnoteRef id=fnref2><sup>2</sup></a>”</em>: inevitably all these emails are from recruitment companies masquerading under the guise of friendly academic collaboration. Well guess what? I don't like <em>friendly academic collaboration</em>. If you have an email like this from me, it means I don't like you.<blockquote><p>Hi <em>person/representative/scumbag</em>,<p>I have not agreed to receive any marketing emails from <em>company/knowledge-hub/parasitic worm</em>. Remove me from all mailing lists immediately.<p>Please also note the Privacy and Electronic Communication Regulations 2003; It is unlawful to send marketing emails or texts to individuals without specific consent.<p><a href=https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/electronic-and-telephone-marketing/electronic-mail-marketing/ class=uri>https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/electronic-and-telephone-marketing/electronic-mail-marketing/</a><p>If I hear from you or your organisation again, other than to confirm my removal from your mailing lists, I shall report this to the ICO.<p>-- Joseph.</blockquote><p>My favorite response so far included:<blockquote><p>The reason I reached out is that your technical history is impressive<ul><li>the <em>mysterious reference to my CV</em> project you gained during your</ul><p>time in <em>Trumpton</em> is something we're keenly interested in. With your background I think you would be able to build something big and really maximise the impact of your research.</blockquote><p>Guess someones been reading my CV. Would be nice if they actually knew what they were talking about and referenced something I'd done in the last five years eh?<p>And my technical history isn't impressive FYI. It isn't bad. I've worked on some interesting projects in my time, but it isn't impressive. I'm quite competent, but that's about it. Stop trying to stroke my ego: if you want my interest talk tech to me and go into lots of deep technical details. I'm an engineer. More tech. Less platitudes.<p>Eurgh. Fuck these guys.<section class=footnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn1><p>What the heck is a webinar?<a href=#fnref1>↩</a><li id=fn2><p>Over my dead body.<a href=#fnref2>↩</a></ol></section></article></section>
