Gone is the Jekyll and the <em>content-management-systems</em>. Instead I have a bunch of org-mode and markdown files, and a <a href=/Makefile>Makefile</a> that builds everything for me.</p><p>There is something deeply enjoyable about making your own things. I <em>could</em> go and buy a cake from the <a href=http://www.thisisanna.co.uk>beautiful patisserie shop</a> up the road from me. It is <em>often</em> (but not always) more fun to bake my own. Programmers know this desire well though that was madness and timewasting lies.<a class=footnoteRef href=#fn1 id=fnref1><sup>1</sup></a> We still program with Lisp, though. We create beautiful if unnecessary abstractions and little tweaks to build our own languages around the problems we solve.</p><p>I got rid of the Jekyll code, ultimately, because I didn't really understand all it was doing, and it was tricky to tweak things. If I wanted to use a different markdown engine, I'd need to find or write a plugin, and look up how to do that. Of course now if I want to do that I still have to do that. The code is trivial however.</p><p>Turn everything thats an org-mode file in the top or second-level directories into HTML.</p><pre class=Make><code>files=$(patsubst %.org,%.html,$(wildcard *.org)) \
      $(patsubst %.org,%.html,$(wildcard */*.org))
all: ${files} 
</code></pre><p>Turn org-to-html like this.</p><pre><code>%.html: %.org bogwonch.html5
    pandoc -t html -f org --template=bogwonch.html5 "${&lt;}" -o "${@}"
</code></pre><p>I'm sure I could do much the same with Jekyll, but I'd have to look it up. Undoubtably I'm more familiar with the four lines of Makefile. It does everything I want. If I want to change it later I can, and my old stuff will keep working. There are no extra directories. No config files.<a class=footnoteRef href=#fn2 id=fnref2><sup>2</sup></a> I don't use Javascript, but I could add some if I wanted to. It was simple, and enjoyable to make. I spent half-an-hour debugging it (mostly CSS which I don't really know).</p><p>I haven't rolled it all myself. Inventing my own markup language, to replace the hybrid of org-mode and Markdown I write in Vim, isn't something I've done. I haven't rolled <strong>everything</strong> myself, but I have just rolled enough to make it enjoyable. Other stuff can come later. I don't feel I've lost anything from the Jekyll. Undoubtably I probably have, but I didn't need it.</p><p>This is fine. This feels good.</p><section class=footnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn1><p>...and frankly security bugs if you roll your own crypto.<a href=#fnref1>↩</a></p></li><li id=fn2><p>Bar a pandoc template, the Makefile and a smidge of <a href=https://sass-lang.com>SASS</a>.
