#+TITLE: Qubes and Keyboards

My favourite keyboard is a /particularly/ gross unicorn vomit
[[http://ortholinearkeyboards.com/planck][Planck Keyboard]].
Unfortunately Qubes /sys-usb/ VM picks it up as a mouse, not a keyboard
and stops it from working (and rightly so).

To get Qubes to prompt if a keyboard should be allowed to attach, like
with mice, in /dom-0/ edit =/etc/qubes-rpc/policy/qubes.InputKeyboard=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    sys-usb dom0 ask,user=root
    $anyvm $anyvm deny
#+END_EXAMPLE

There we go! Much better.

Obviously this is a /bit/ of a security risk. Someone could modify my
keyboard to type naughty commands into the secure bits of my computer.
Whilst I did program my keyboard, I don't know if anyone has modified it
since then. A risk I have to take I guess if I want to use my unicorn
vomit though!

(Incidentally what is to stop someone modifying my laptop to do much the
same attack other than ease of access?)
