#+TITLE: Solving a Simple Problem with a SAT solver.

I read a simple maths problem in [[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/dec/05/did-you-solve-it-are-you-smarter-than-a-singaporean-ten-year-old][Alex Bellos’s column in the Guardian]].
The problem goes:

#+begin_quote
There are four numbers. If we leave out any one number, the average of the
remaining three numbers will be 45, 60, 65 or 70. What is the average of all
four numbers?
#+end_quote

The solution goes:

- Write means of three as equation:
  - A + B + C     = 45*3
  - A + B +     D = 60*3
  - A +     C + D = 65*3
  - B + C + D = 70*3

- Sum means:
  - 3(A + B + C + D) = 3(45 + 60 + 65 + 70)
  - A + B + C + D = 240

- We want:
  - A + B + C + D = 4 Answer
  - Answer = 240 / 4
  - Answer = 60

Alternatively we can give the problem to the
[[https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3][Z3]] theorem prover…

#+begin_src python :session :results output
from z3 import *

a = Int('a')
b = Int('b')
c = Int('c')
d = Int('d')

x = Int('x')

s = Solver()

s.add(  (a + b + c)/3 == 45,
        (a + b + d)/3 == 60,
        (a + c + d)/3 == 65,
        (b + c + d)/3 == 70,
        (a + b + c + d)/4 == x)

print(s.check())
print(s.model())
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
: >>> >>> >>> >>> >>> >>> >>> >>> >>> >>> ... ... ... ... >>> >>> sat
: [b = 45, a = 30, c = 60, d = 105, x = 60]

Complete overkill… but a neat trick!
