A collection of my writings and various other things!
I make [[file:shirts][shirts]] and I play with [[https://github.com/bogwonch][computers]].

Almost all of this is written in [[file:index.org][org-mode]] and exported
through [[file:bogwonch.html5][pandoc]].

* Blogs

I rarely blog. Mostly just random notes.
