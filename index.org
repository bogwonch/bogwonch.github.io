A collection of my writings and various other things.
I make [[file:shirts][shirts]] and I play with [[https://github.com/bogwonch][computers]].
I do research for the [[http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/research/cyber-security/][Bristol Cyber Security Group]].

Almost all of this is written in [[file:index.org][org-mode]] and exported
through [[file:bogwonch.html5][pandoc]].

* Notes

* Blogs

I rarely blog. Mostly just random notes.
